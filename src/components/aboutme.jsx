<div className="col col-xs-12">I have over 2 years of experience as a Customer Support Associate in eMart Pvt. Ltd. After working as
a CSA, I decided to make a move to IT. I have done some training and certifications in manual testing,
J2EE, Agile and learned Web Development from NIIT Bengaluru. Front-End development
technologies caught my interest and from thereon I have been learning HTML5, CCS3 and JavaScript.
I have developed several prototypes and projects while learning. I like to develop using ReactJS and
have done several projects on it. I am well versed with agile software delivery process. I am very
passionate, quick learner, eager to take a challenging work and give my best. I want to be part of
